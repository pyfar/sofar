API Reference
=============

This section documents sofar objects and functions. Sofar contains functions
for reading, writing and comparing SOFA files, functions to handle SOFA
conventions, and two classes to handle data from SOFA files. The
:py:class:`~sofar.Sofa` class is used to read and write entire SOFA files. To
open a SOFA file without reading the entire file into memory,
:py:class:`~sofar.SofaStream` enables partially reading data.

For examples on how to use sofar refer to the
:ref:`sofar and SOFA <gallery:/gallery/interactive/sofar_introduction.ipynb>`
notebook and the documentation below.

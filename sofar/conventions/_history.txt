Proposed
----------

- Fixed inconsistencies and errors in the csv convention files (see detailed list below).
- Replaced non-ASCII quotes by `'`
- Removed empty tabs at line ends (done automatically by my IDE. Sorry, this makes the diffs look a bit messi. Using Meld (https://meldmerge.org/) shows the differences in a more comprehensible way)
- added a gitignore for compiled conventions stored in mat files

Test of changes
----------------
- SOFAstart.m still seems to create the mat convention files without throwing any errors
- I am currently writing a Python API for SOFA that uses the csv files from APIMO. As part of that, I wrote a verify function that discovered the inconsistencies. It checks the following:
   - Are all mandatory fields contained?
   - Are the names of variables and attributes in accordance to the SOFA standard?
   - Are the data types in accordance with the SOFA standard?
   - Are the dimensions of the variables consistent and in accordance to the SOFA standard?
   - Are the values of attributes consistent and in accordance to the SOFA standard?
  
Question
---------
Should the version number of APIMO be increased to make the fixes more visible.

Detailed list of changes
-----------------------

**FreeFieldDirectivityTF_1.0**
- EmitterDescription: change dimensions from 'IC, MS' to 'IS, MS' according to
  AES69
- SourceTuningFrequency: change default from ''  (empty string) to 440. This is a variable of
  type double. It can not have a string as default.
- EmitterDescription, Description: changed type from "attribute" to "string" as for string variables in SimpleHeadphoneIR
- EmitterDescription, Description: changed default from Nothing to {''} as for string variables in SimpleHeadphoneIR
- N:Units: Changed default value from 'Hertz' to 'hertz' to be case sensitive as enforced in AES69


**FreeFieldHRTF_1.0, GeneralTF_1.0, GeneralTF_2.0, GeneralTF-E_1.0, SimpleFreeFieldHRTF_2.0**
- N_LongName, and N_Units: Change to N:LongName, and N:Units. Both fields are
  attributes which is otherwise denoted by Var:Attribute and not Var_Attribute

**GeneralFIR-E_2.0, GeneralTF-E**
- ReceiverPosition: Change from 'I, R, M, RM, RCI, RCM' to 'IC, RC, RCM'
  according to AES69, 4.7.4
- EmitterPosition: Change from 'I, E, M, EM, ECI, ECM' to 'IC, EC, ECM'
  according to AES69, 4.7.6

**GeneralFIR_2.0, GeneralTF_2.0**
- ReceiverPosition: Changed from 'I, R, IM, RM, RCI, RCM', to 'IC, RC, RCM' in
  analogy to GeneralFIR-E_2.0

**GeneeralTF_1.0, GeneralTF_2.0**
- N:LongName: made a default value

**SingleRoomDRIR_0.3.csv**
- Data.IR and Data.Delay: Change default from '[0, 0]' to '[0]' because the
  ReceiverPosition only has one entry (We could also change the Receiver-
  Position, but this is the minimal example)
- Data.IR: Change dimensions from 'mRn' to 'mrn' according to AES69
- ReceiverPosition: Change dimension from 'rCI, 'rCM'' to 'RCI, RCM' according
  to AES69
- ListenerView:Units, SourceView:Units: Added missing default attributes

**SingleRoomSRIR_1.0**
Has the attributes RoomCorners:Type and RoomCorners:Units but no variable of
the same name - variables are RoomCornerA and RoomCornerB
- removed idle attributes and created attributes RoomCornerA:*, and
  RoomCornerB*

**SingleRoomMimoSRIR_1.0, SingleRoomSRIR_1.0**
- Corrected type in EmiiterView:Type to EmitterView:Type

**SimpleFreeFieldHRSOS_1.0, SimpleFreeFieldSOS_1.0***
- N: Added missing default parameter according to AES69
- N: Changed Field *Dimensions* from 'N' to 'I'. I think this is an error in AES69

**SimpleFreeFieldSOS_1.0**
- ReceiverPosition, Data_N:SOS: Fields are copoed from SimpleFreeFieldHRSOS containing default values for two receivers. I assume this is not intended.

**FreeFieldHRIR**
- Convention defined in AES69 but not contained in API_MO

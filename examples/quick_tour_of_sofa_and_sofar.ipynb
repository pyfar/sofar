All entires starting with *GLOBAL* are such attributes. Specific attributes hold meta data for a certain variable. These attributes thus start with the name of the variable followed by an underscore, e.g., *ListenerPosition_Units*. An exception to this rule are the data variables, e.g, *Data_IR* is not an attribute but a double variable.\n",
